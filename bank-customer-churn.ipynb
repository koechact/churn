INTRODUCTION\n\nCustomer churn is when someone chooses to stop using your products or services. In effect, it’s when a customer ceases to be a customer.\nCustomer churn is measured using customer churn rate. That’s the number of people who stopped being customers during a set period of time, such as a year, a month or a financial quarter. We are going to predict customer churn within the banking space.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.
